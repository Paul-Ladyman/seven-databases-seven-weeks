Basic Commands
==============

show dbs
show collections

- A mongo instance/cluster is made up of databases (dbs) which contain collections

db.towns.insert({
  name: "New York",
  population: 22200000,
  famous_for: ["statue of liberty", "food"]
})

- db = database
- towns = collection to be created or updated
- Can insert JSON documents using Javascript syntax (no quotes for keys). Nested to any depth
- Databases are not properly created until some data is inserted into a collection

db.towns.find()

- inspect a collection

> typeof db
object
> typeof db.towns
object
> typeof db.towns.insert
function

- Mongo commands are themselves Javascript entities.

function insertCity(
  name, population, last_census,
  famous_for, mayor_info
) {
  db.towns.insert({
    name:name,
    population:population,
    last_census: ISODate(last_census),
    famous_for:famous_for,
    mayor : mayor_info
  });
}

insertCity("Punxsutawney", 6200, '2008-01-31', ["phil the groundhog"], {name: "Jim Wehrle"})
insertCity("London", 1000000, '2008-01-31', ["Big Ben"], {name: "Boris Johnson", party:"Tories"})

- Can use this to create custom Javascript functions
- Notice the documents being added to the towns collection do not have a standard format

Read Queries
============

db.towns.find({name: "New York"}, {population: 1})

- Find based on document properties
- Second argument defines which fields should be returned (using 1 or true) or not returned
(using 0 or false)

db.towns.find(
  {name: /^P/, population: {$lt: 10000}},
  {name: 1, population: 1}
)

- Regex matching following perl regex (PCRE)
- Conditional operator $lt (less than). Conditional operators take the form {$op: value}

var population_range = {}
population_range['$lt'] = 2000000
population_range['$gt'] = 10000
db.towns.find(
  {population: population_range},
  {name: 1, population: 1}
)

- Use Javascript language to construct query operators

db.towns.find(
  {last_census: {$lte: ISODate('2008-31-01')}}
)

- Conditional operator with date range

Querying Nested Data
===================

db.towns.find(
  {famous_for: 'food'},
  {_id: 0, name: 1, famous_for: 1}
)

- Query for presence a single value within an array (famous_for)

db.towns.find(
  {famous_for: /statue/},
  {_id: 0, name: 1, famous_for: 1}
)

- Query for presence of single partial value within an array

db.towns.find(
  {famous_for: {$all: [/statue/, 'food']}},
  {_id: 0, name: 1, famous_for: 1}
)

- Query for presence of entire array with mixed value matchers

db.towns.find(
  {famous_for: {$nin: ['food']}},
  {_id: 0, name: 1, famous_for: 1}
)

- Query for lack of value/s

db.towns.find(
  {'mayor.party': 'Tories'},
  {_id: 0, name: 1, mayor: 1}
)

- Digging down into nested objects (mayor -> party)

db.towns.find(
  {'mayor.party': {$exists: false}},
  {_id: 0, name: 1, mayor: 1}
)

- Query for lack of particular key

db.countries.insert({
  _id: 'us',
  name: 'United States',
  exports: {
    foods: [
      {name: 'bacon', tasty: true},
      {name: 'burgers'}
    ]
  }
})
db.countries.insert({
  _id: 'ca',
  name: 'Canada',
  exports: {
    foods: [
      {name: 'bacon', tasty: false},
      {name: 'syrup', tasty: true}
    ]
  }
})
db.countries.insert({
  _id: 'mx',
  name: 'Mexico',
  exports: {
    foods: [
      {name: 'salsa', tasty: true, condiment: true}
    ]
  }
})

- Can override _id to be any string
- Can't insert an array, must be an object

db.countries.find(
  {
    'exports.foods': {
      $elemMatch: {
        name: 'bacon',
        tasty: true
      }
    }
  },
  {_id: 0, name: 1}
)

- $elemMatch operator means object must match each criteria to be included in the results.

db.countries.find(
  {
    'exports.foods': {
      $elemMatch: {
        tasty: true,
        condiment: {$exists: true}
      }
    }
  },
  {_id: 0, name: 1}
)

- Can combine other advanced operators with $elemMatch

Boolean Operators
=================

db.countries.find(
  {
    $or: [
      {_id: 'mx'},
      {name: 'United States'}
    ]
  },
  {_id: 0, name: 1}
)

- OR matcher. Countries with _id: 'mx' OR name: 'United States'.
There are many boolean operators.

Updates
=======

db.towns.update(
  { name: 'New York' },
  { $set : { state: 'NY' } }
)

- First argument is a criteria query like for find()
- Second is a modifier operation describing what to change about the matched document
- Could also be an entirely new document to replace the existing one with

db.towns.update(
  { name: 'London' },
  { $inc : { population: 2000000 } }
)

- Other modifier operations available such as $inc, to increment an integer value

References
==========

db.towns.update(
  {name: 'New York'},
  {$set: {country: {$ref: 'countries', $id: 'us'}}}
)

- Can references other documents in different collections if necessary.

> db.towns.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("566309d18adfd4a864515c37"), "name" : "New York", "population" : 22200000, "famous_for" : [ "statue of liberty", "food" ], "state" : "NY", "country" : DBRef("countries", "us") }

- Results in a DBRef object
- Docs say that this is used to provide a common interface for referring to other documents and other
collections. Could also just manually include a reference to another document's _id
- Docs recommend to use manual references unless there's a specific reason to use DBRef

var newYork = db.towns.findOne({name: 'New York'})
db.countries.findOne({_id: newYork.country.$id})

- Can then use this reference to lookup
- Notice that a second query has to be performed, joins are not available in MongoDB.
This is because of its distributed nature!
- If this is undesirable then denormalizing data is common practice for NoSQL stores
- Another example of querying using Javascript language constructs

db[newYork.country.$ref].findOne({_id: newYork.country.$id})

- Could rewrite the above to dynamically lookup the referenced collection as well as the document id.
- db is an object containing collections!

Deleting
========

var bad_bacon = {
  'exports.foods': {
    $elemMatch: {
      name: 'bacon',
      tasty: false
    }
  }
}
db.countries.find(bad_bacon)

db.countries.remove(bad_bacon)

- remove function takes same kind of query object as find and update.

Querying with Code
==================

db.towns.find(function () {
  return this.population > 6000 && this.population < 600000
})

- MongoDB can apply Javascript functions to queries.
- Iterates through every document in towns collection and applies function. this refers to current
document
- function returns a boolean for a match
- Relatively slow process and cannot be indexed or optimised

db.towns.find('this.population > 6000 && this.population < 600000')

- shorthand available for simple boolean operations

db.towns.find({
  $where: 'this.population > 6000 && this.population < 600000',
  famous_for: /groundhog/
})

- Can combine custom query functions with other standard criteria using the $where operator
- Works for both shorthand and full Javascript function syntax
