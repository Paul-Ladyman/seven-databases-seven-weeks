results = db.runCommand({
  mapReduce: 'phones',
  map: map,
  reduce: reduce,
  out: 'phones.report',
  finalize: function(key, reducedValue) {
    return {total: reducedValue.count};
  }
})

- Finalize is a function run at the very end of the mapreduce operation allowing a final
map or aggregation to be performed before the results are returned to the client.
