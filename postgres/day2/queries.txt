Sub Selects
==========

Rather than setting a value explicitly, sub-SELECT it using another query.

INSERT INTO events (title, starts, ends, venue_id)
	VALUES ('Lunch', '2012-02-16 12:30:00', '2012-02-16 13:30:00', (
		SELECT venue_id
		FROM venues
		WHERE name = 'My Place'
	)
);

Aggregate Functions
===================

Groups results from several rows by some common criteria

SELECT count(title)
FROM events
WHERE title LIKE '%er%';

- Aggregate function count
- LIKE search function. % is a wildcard

SELECT min(starts), max(ends)
FROM events e JOIN venues v
	ON e.venue_id = v.venue_id
WHERE v.name = 'My Place';

- min and max aggregate functions
